# turn_based_card_game_JavaFX

JavaFX version of turn_based_card_game

there are 2 players, and mana is the currency of the game. the amount of mana equals the tour number the players are on. they can spend them with drawing cards which come in 5 rarities: bad, bad-mid, mid, mid-good, good. each cost has 5 cards hat are randomly pulled. so, there are 25 cards in total. I could add 25 more cards and make cost limit 10, but I don't want to be fully focused on JavaFX and games so early, so I will stick with this.

after making the turn_based_card_game, creating the JavaFX version with buttons, visuals exc. took me 6 days and I enjoyed it! 

game rules

- a player can be attacked only if there is no creature to defend

- mana does not carry over to the next tour

- player 1 starts the game first, then players take turns in order

- creatures' special abilities get applied at the end of each tour
