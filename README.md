# turn_based_card_game_JavaFX

JavaFX version of turn_based_card_game

There are 2 players, with mana as a currency of this game. mana equals to tour number players are in and they gotta spend them with drawing cards which has rarities of 5. Each cost has 5 cards with being randomly pulled. They have 5 rarities which is bad, bad-mid, mid, mid-good, good. That means there is 30 cards to be pulled. To be honest I could add 30 more cards and make cost up-limit 10 but I don't wanna be fully focused at javafx and games so I guess that's it for now.

After making the turn_based_card_game, making JavaFX version with buttons, visuals exc. took me 6 days and I enjoyed it!
